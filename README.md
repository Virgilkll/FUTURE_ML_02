Customer Churn Prediction System

Machine Learning | Data Analytics | Business Intelligence

* Project Overview
  
  Customer churn is a critical challenge for subscription-based businesses such as telecom, banking, and SaaS companies.
  This project builds an end-to-end churn prediction system that identifies customers likely to churn and provides business-ready insights using Machine Learning, Python, and Power BI.


The solution combines:

  Data preprocessing & feature engineering
  Classification modeling
  Model evaluation
  Business-focused dashboards for decision-making

* Objectives

  Predict churn probability for each customer
  Identify key drivers of churn
  Enable data-driven retention strategies
  Present insights in an interactive Power BI dashboard

* Tools & Technologies

  Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  Scikit-learn
  XGBoost
  Jupyter Notebook
  Power BI
  GitHub

* Dataset

  Telco Customer Churn Dataset
  Includes customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn labels

* Key columns:
  gender, SeniorCitizen, Contract
  InternetService, PaymentMethod
  MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
  Churn

* Key Insights

  Month-to-month contracts show the highest churn rate
  Customers with high monthly charges are more likely to churn
  Payment method and contract type are strong churn drivers
  High-risk customers can be proactively targeted for retention
